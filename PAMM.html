            <h1>Academic Position Paper</h1>
            <p>Many people know it as being taboo to talk about politics, and this leads curious people to wonder why. To get an answer requires diving into the very world of suffering this taboo seeks to save you from. There is no other way of discovery. Politics can lead to ruined relationships and toxic environments and sometimes even losing your career over a post on social media. If they would only stop being deliberately blind to your obviously fool proof logic to save the world! Everything would be perfect if you were in charge, right? American society is very polarized and divisive, and such tension among the populous can have very negative consequences; to avoid these consequences one only needs an outside perspective of the way the game works.</p>
            <p>American society is very polarized and divisive in this day and age. Yuan Hsiao and Scott Radnitz, finds that there is a partisan bias in how individuals view the severity of violence in protests. They do this by showing that everyone views throwing rocks as violent while just holding signs or even blocking traffic qualifies as not violent. Recognizing blatant violence seems to be universal but when topics become partisan then confirmation bias skews people’s perspectives. According to Pew research, nearly fifty percent of partisans see the opposing party as a threat to the nation’s wellbeing. Scott Ellison predicts that western civilization is entering a period of crisis. Often people have no interest in thorough conversations with people who disagree or simply write others off as ignorant. Many conversations quickly devolve into something less civilized with everyone talking past each other with nothing tangible being accomplished other than alienation.</p>
            <p>polarization left unchecked has the potential for very negative consequences. According to Allies and Agitators, nonviolent protests historically have had large and immensely positive impacts, but positive effects such as these do not occur if the audience of such protests perceives them as violent. This is an increasing occurrence in today’s cultural turmoil. Pew Research suggests that the partisan divide in our country has been growing farther apart. Many people see the opposing party as a threat. Ellison notes a relatively recent sharp rise in radical right-wing ideologies in western governments while Raphael Lataster and Rumy Hasan claim that the leadership on the left is backing American intervention abroad more and more.  Destabilization of the United States would have many negative consequences around the world such as economic stagnation and regression as well as hindering the relative peace that our country plays a big role in facilitating.</p>
            <p>In order to avoid these consequences, we should educate ourselves of these various communicative strategies and how to handle each in a productive way. Igor Grossmann points out a growing outcry among the scientific community that he characterizes as a call for greater wisdom of the population. Grossman defines wisdom as, “…morally-grounded excellence in social-cognitive processing.” and then continues to present empirical evidence on why wisdom is beneficial to society. People should avoid falling for tricks and be aware that public figures choose the language they broadcast to further their own agenda. Many of them to varying degrees are not past deception. Politicians usually choose a political party for the benefits that come with the infrastructure of these parties but are not necessarily loyal to the party ideals. Rather they use the party as a steppingstone to accomplish their own personal agenda. This aspect, though sometimes dishonest. Their dishonesty shows itself when they address the public. They are not genuine in their addresses but measured. Again, they are not using this for the greater good necessarily but to again work towards their personal agendas. This becomes an issue when politicians are able to manipulate their audiences. One aspect of public speeches that happens to drive support is outrage at the opposition. When this is accomplished all that has to be done is convince the population that you are the best individual to curb the opposition. Though possibly effective these strategies create fractures in a society that have long-term consequences. Individuals with a stake in the stability of United States politics including American citizens whose daily lives are directly affected by the degradation of the United States government. American politicians and public officials are in the best position to guide the stability and trustworthiness of the government, so this is also relevant to them. There are also many countries around the world who’s standing, and stability depend on the United States and therefore their inhabitants do as well. Wisdom, as Grossman explains it can be used as a tool against deception. Due to many public figures and the media fear mongering, there are many people genuinely afraid that their fellow Americans are trying to destroy the world as we know it. Rather than rashly responding to the divisive rhetoric of politicians, step back and make rational decisions. Individuals should use a healthy skepticism of public figures, resist being reactive and make deliberate measured the crisis can be avoided. They should take on the responsibility and be wise instead of trusting others to be wise for them.</p>
            <p>The taboo of speaking about politics, though an attempt to keep a calm and appropriate environment, lacks perspective. It is akin to putting a band-aid over an infected wound. A futile attempt to keep the toxicity out of your bubble while ignoring that we are all part of the outside world, and we are the fix to the problem. American society is very polarized and divisive and each of us make up that very society. Pressure ignored becomes explosive and that is exactly what we don’t want.  To avoid these consequences, each of us needs knowledge and an honest attitude towards our true goals. The world won’t end if you happen to be wrong about something, but it might end as we know it if you don’t have the chance to find out you’re wrong about something without in a less consequential way.</p>
