                <h1>What to do in our current political and cultural environment.</h1>
                <p>American society is very polarized and divisive, and such tension among the populous can have very negative consequences; to avoid these consequences one only needs an outside perspective of the way the game works.</p>
                <p>American society is very polarized and divisive in this day and age. Yuan Hsiao and Scott Radnitz, finds that there is a partisan bias in how individuals view the severity of violence in protests. They do this by showing that everyone views throwing rocks as violent while just holding signs or even blocking traffic qualifies as not violent. Recognizing blatant violence seems to be universal, but when topics become partisan then confirmation bias skews people’s perspectives. According to Pew research, nearly fifty percent of partisans see the opposing party as a threat to the nation’s wellbeing and also suggests that the partisan divide in our country has been growing farther apart.</p>
                <p>People should avoid falling for tricks and be aware that public figures choose the language they broadcast to further their own agenda. Many of them to varying degrees are not past deception. Their dishonesty shows itself when they address the public. They are not genuine in their addresses but measured. Again, they are not using this for the greater good necessarily but to work for their own benefit. This becomes an issue when politicians can be benefit from harming society. Wisdom, as Grossman explains it can be used as a tool against deception. Due to many public figures and the media fear mongering, there are many people genuinely afraid that their fellow Americans are trying to destroy the world as we know it. Rather than rashly responding to the divisive rhetoric of politicians, step back and make rational decisions. American politicians and public officials are in the best position to guide the stability and trustworthiness of the government, hold them accountable.</p>
                <p>Politicians usually choose a political party for the benefits that come with the infrastructure of these parties but are not necessarily loyal to the party ideals. Rather they use the party as a steppingstone to accomplish their own personal agenda.</p> 
                <p>One aspect of public speeches that happens to drive support is outrage at the opposition. When this is accomplished all that has to be done is convince the population that you are the best individual to curb the opposition. Polarization, left unchecked, has the potential for very negative consequences. According to Allies and Agitators, nonviolent protests historically have had large and immensely positive impacts, but positive effects such as these do not occur if the audience of such protests perceives them as violent. This is an increasing occurrence in today’s cultural turmoil.</p>
                <p>Though possibly effective these strategies create fractures in a society that have long-term consequences. Individuals with a stake in the stability of United States politics, including American citizens whose daily lives are directly affected by the degradation of the United States government, should be concerned. There are also many countries around the world who’s standing, and stability depend on the United States and therefore their inhabitants do as well.</p>
