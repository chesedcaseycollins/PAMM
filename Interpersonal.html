                <h1>You and I can change the world.</h1>
                <p>Many people know it as being taboo to talk about politics, and this leads curious people to wonder why. To get an answer requires diving into the very world of suffering this taboo seeks to save you from. There is no other way of discovery. Often people have no interest in thorough conversations with people who disagree with them or simply write others off as ignorant. Many conversations quickly devolve into something less than civilized with everyone talking past each other and nothing tangible being accomplished other than alienation. Politics can lead to ruined relationships and toxic environments and sometimes even losing your career over a post on social media. If they would only stop being deliberately blind to your obviously fool proof logic to save the world! Everything would be perfect if you were in charge, right? The taboo of speaking about politics, though an attempt to keep a calm and appropriate environment, lacks perspective. It is akin to putting a band-aid over an infected wound it doesn’t solve the problem. We are all part of the outside world, and we are the fix to the problem. American society is very polarized and divisive and each of us make up that very society. We should take on the responsibility and be wise instead of trusting others to be wise for us. We can’t ignore the problem and hope it goes away. This approach will likely only make it worse.  To avoid a negative outcome, each of us needs knowledge and an honest attitude towards our true goals. The world won’t end if you happen to be wrong about something or we don’t get something we believe to be the best, but it might end as we know it if you don’t have the chance to find out you’re wrong about something in a less consequential way.</p>
                <p>In order to avoid these consequences, we should educate ourselves of these various communicative strategies and how to handle our communication in a productive way. Igor Grossmann points out a growing outcry among the scientific community that he characterizes as a call for greater wisdom of the population. Grossman defines wisdom as, “…morally-grounded excellence in social-cognitive processing.” and then continues to present empirical evidence on why wisdom is beneficial to society. </p>
