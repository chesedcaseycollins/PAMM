                <p class="top">One moment of political dishonesty and manipulation does not define a politician. Though, it should set off a red flag. Examples like the ones that follow are all over the internet and reveal a pattern, which moving forward, we should steer away from.</p>

                <p>Donald trump is the 45th President of the United States.</p>
                <p>Before his election to president, Donald Trump promised to build a border wall that Mexico would pay for. After his electionhe claimed that he never meant that Mexico would pay for the wall directly. This shows that he is willing to make unrealistic promises to the american people in order to gain support.</p>

                <p>Joe Biden is the 46th President of the United States. He was the 47th Vice President and served in the senate for thirty-six years.</p>
                <p>Joe Biden, prior to being elected President of the United States, stated that travel bans due to COVID-19 were minimally effective and claimed they were xenophobic. That was when his opponent in the presidential race was making the policies. Now that he is President he has put new travel bans in place due to COVID-19. This shows that Joe Biden will slander his opponent to put himself in a better light and then turn around and do exactly what he previously claimed was not right.</p>

                <p>Kamala Harris is the 47th vice president of the United States and served in the senate for four years.</p>
                <p>Kamala Harris, prior to being elected Vice President of the United States, stated that she will not take the corona virus vaccine if, then president, Donald Trump says to take it. Later, after she has won the election, she says everyone should take the vaccine. She reveals that in this comparison she decided to misslead the public rather than say anything that could put her opposition in a good light.</p>
